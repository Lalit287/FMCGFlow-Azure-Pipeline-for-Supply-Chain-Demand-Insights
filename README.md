FMCGFlow â€“ Azure Pipeline for Supply Chain Demand Insights


ðŸ“Œ Overview
FMCGFlow is a data engineering project designed for a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company to analyze historical sales and various business drivers. It enables data-driven supply chain decisions without predictive models by building an Azure-powered ETL pipeline and delivering insights through Power BI dashboards.

Dataset: Strategic Supply Chain Demand Forecasting Dataset(kaggle)


ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
Centralize and process structured FMCG sales data.

Understand the impact of promotions, holidays, pricing, economic factors, and weather on sales.

Create a secure and monitored Azure data pipeline with end-to-end reporting.


ðŸš€ Key Features
Centralized Storage: Raw and cleaned data stored in Azure Blob/Data Lake Gen2.

Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Python-based processing using Pandas & NumPy.

ETL Orchestration: Azure Data Factory pipelines to transform and load data.

Analytics Database: Azure SQL Database with star schema for BI reporting.

Power BI Dashboards: Interactive insights on sales performance, promotions, and trends.

Enterprise Practices: Credential management with Azure Key Vault, monitoring with Azure Monitor.
